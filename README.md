# MacMachineLearningDemo

The mac application of this repository was built to teach myself how to utilise CreateML and Xcode to create machine-learning powerered applications.

The current application has the following features/capabilities.

- Static Image Classification
- Hand Pose Detection and Prediction (including augmentation)

### Notes

For thsoe trying to run the `Hand Pose Identification` I have found that this works best with my M1 MBP. When tested on an 2017-intel MBP predictions were slow and meant the whole program failed to perform as expected.
